# Sufflain's server-side application
*This script tracks timetables changes on the site of my college and stores them in a database.
The data is accessed through the web app.*

## Docker container demo
*The iteration is quick because there are no timetable changes.*

### Explanation
The computed hashes are equal to those stored in the database.
That means the data didn't change.
The app will wait for the next iteration (the default wait time is 30 minutes).

## How does it work?
1. Every *[specified time]* minutes the app gets the blog page from the college site.
2. For every blog post title, a hash is computed.
3. For every blog post timetable, a hash is computed.
4. After that, depending on the situation, the app will either add, update, or remove from the database a timetable with its hashes.

### Hashes - the key component
We use them to find out if there are any changes or not.

**The timetable for each date can be accessed by its hash, as shown in the figure below:**

### Timetable info structure
**The structure is similar for each group.**

## Project configuration
### Firebase
1. Create a user with an Email provider.
2. Make sure that Firebase Realtime Database write permissions are allowed *only* for a user with a specific UID.

### Realtime Database Rules
**The following rules are recommended:**

![firebase rules](img/firebase-rules.png)

*Replace "\<your-user-uid\>" with the actual UID. You will use this user to access private locations in the database.*

### Docker
1. Create a directory called *private* in the project root directory.
2. Copy the program's config file from the [template](./template) directory to *private*.

### Standard
1. Copy the program's config file from the [template](./template) directory to *$HOME/.config*.

*In both cases, you need to fill the config file with your own data.*

## Build
### Docker
```bash
make docker
```

Issuing this command results in building a docker image tagged as "*sufflain-server*."

### Standard
1. Run a script for resolving dependencies. Use either a PowerShell or shell script, depending on your system:
```powershell
.\resolve-deps.ps1
```
*or*
```sh
./resolve-deps.sh
```
2. Use GNU Make to test and build the app itself:
```sh
make
```

## Usage
1. Get groups from a specific timetable:
```bash
sfl --get-groups [specific timetable url]
```
or
```bash
sfl -g [specific timetable url]
```

The command above will extract groups from the page and add them to the database.

2. Run the app:
```bash
sfl --track
```
or
```bash
sfl -t
```
